# MediPi Clinician Application


## Software
This is an implementation of a Clinician application (It is intended to be used in with the MediPi Patient and Medipi Concentrator implementation which is published alongside this GitHub repository). It has been developed to be flexible and extensible.

This project started as a demonstration of a general telehealth system but with clinical involvement from a Hertfordshire Community NHS Trust, it has been developed into a Heart Failure implementation.
The project is written using Java, Spring Boot, Hibernate, JQuery, JSP and Postgres Database. The application is designed on the SOA principles. The [medipi-clinician-service](https://github.com/rprobinson/MediPi/tree/master/Application/Services/medipi-clinician-service) exposes the APIs to get/post the data to/from the database and [medipi-clinician-web-application](https://github.com/rprobinson/MediPi/tree/master/Application/Web-Aplication/medipi-clinician-web-application) provides the UI for clinicians to monitor the patients which in-turn access the APIs exposed by medipi-clinician-service.

It is intended to be used in with the MediPi Patient and Medipi Concentrator implementation which is published alongside this GitHub repository.

Functionality:

* Medipi clinician service:
	* APIs related to patients: 
        * Get all patients registered in the system
        * Get patient details with `patientUUID`
        * Get recorded patient measurements with `patientUUID` and `attributeName`
    * APIs related to Patient Attribute Thresholds: For each patient there will be different threshold for each measurement attribute. These threshold values will determine whether measurements submitted by patients are within the permissible range.
        * Get the attribute threshold for `patientUUID` and `attributeName`
        * Add the new attribute threshold for `patientUUID` and `attributeName`

* Medipi clinician web:
	* Patients Monitoring: A graphical interface to monitor all the registerd patients in the tile format. Red, Amber, Green and Readings unavailable tiles to indicate patients health according to last measurements submitted.
	* Patient History: The screen which presents all the measurements submitted by patients in the graphs format with threshold indicators.
    * Display & Modify Thresholds: On the patient details page, recent measurement and attribute threshold is also displayed. Clinician can modify these thresholds which will be effective from the date of modification.

## Postgres DB
The Clinician service uses an instance of Postgres (v9.4.8). The data in this database is a subset of the data from Concentrator database. A scheduler will run in the background which will synchronize the data between these two database instances. 

For testing, you can create a new postgres database with name 'Clinical' and execute the script `{medipi-repo-directory}/MediPi/Application/Database-Scripts/MediPi-Clinical_DDL_DML.sql`

# Quick Start Guide

1. Build the required service jar and application war using maven build. Navigate to `{medipi-repo-directory}/MediPi/Application` in the cloned repository and execute `mvn clean install`

2. Copy the deployables
    * `{medipi-repo-directory}/MediPi/Application/Services/medipi-clinician-service/target/medipiClinicianService.jar` file to `C:\MediPiClinical` (Windows) or `/home/{user}/MediPiClinical/` (Linux) directory
    * `{medipi-repo-directory}/MediPi/Application/Web-Aplication/medipi-clinician-web-application/target/medipiClinicianWebApp.war` file to `C:\MediPiClinical` (Windows) or `/home/{user}/MediPiClinical/` (Linux) directory

3. Copy the `{medipi-repo-directory}/MediPi/Application/configurations/services.properties` file to `C:\MediPiClinical` (Windows) or `/home/{user}/MediPiClinical/` (Linux) directory and update the database related properties

    <pre><code>#-----------Database configurations-----------
    medipi.clinician.service.jdbc.driver=org.postgresql.Driver
    medipi.clinician.service.jdbc.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/Clinical
    medipi.clinician.service.jdbc.username=postgres
    medipi.clinician.service.jdbc.password=Password1</code></pre>

4. Install postgres database - the version tested is v9.4.8

5. Create a database 'Clinical'

6. Execute sql script `{medipi-repo-directory}/MediPi/Application/Database-Scripts/MediPi-Clinical_DDL_DML.sql` on the Clinical database

7. Execute MediPi Clinician service using:

        For Windows: java -jar /home/{user}/MediPiClinical/medipiClinicianService.jar --spring.config.location=/home/{user}/MediPiClinical/services.properties
        For Linux: java -jar C:/MediPiClinical/medipiClinicianService.jar --spring.config.location=file:/C:/MediPiClinical/services.properties

8. Execute MediPi Clinician web application using:

        For Windows: java -jar /home/{user}/MediPiClinical/medipiClinicianWebApp.war --spring.config.location=/home/{user}/MediPiClinical/services.properties
        For Linux: java -jar C:/MediPiClinical/medipiClinicianWebApp.war --spring.config.location=file:/C:/MediPiClinical/services.properties
